  interest_score_max:
    type: distribution
    description: >
      Maximum possible cosine similarity between the user's interest vector and all potential suggestion interest vectors.
      Multiplied by 100 to make it an integer for Glean.
    range_min: 0
    range_max: 100
    bucket_count: 50
    histogram_type: linear

  interest_score_max_single_topic:
    type: distribution
    description: >
      Maximum possible cosine similarity between the user's interest vector single-entry interest vectors.
      These are interest vectors with `1` for a single interest and `0` for all other elements.
      Multiplied by 100 to make it an integer for Glean.
    range_min: 0
    range_max: 100
    bucket_count: 50
    histogram_type: linear

  interest_score_non_inconclusive:
    type: distribution
    description: >
      Interest score similarity between the user's interest vector and the "non-inconclusive" interest vector.
      This is the vector with `1` for all elements, except `Inconclusive` which is 0.
      Multiplied by 100 to make it an integer for Glean.
    range_min: 0
    range_max: 100
    bucket_count: 50
